# LAN-Based Automatic Software Installation System

Automatically installs software on all LAN-connected devices with no user interaction required. This system enables a central admin to deploy installation files to multiple machines on the same network and execute them silently using pre-configured agents.

---

## 🔧 Features

* 🚀 One-click deployment from admin machine
* 📦 Silent software installation on clients
* 🔗 Auto-discovery of LAN-connected systems
* 🔐 Secure file transfer and execution
* 📝 Centralized logging of actions

---

## 🖥️ System Architecture

* **Admin Server**

  * Hosts installation files
  * Sends commands and scripts to clients
* **Client Agents**

  * Continuously listen for instructions from the server
  * Automatically download and install packages silently
* **Communication**

  * Local TCP socket or REST API
  * Optional encryption and authentication

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* LAN-connected systems
* PowerShell (Windows) or Bash (Linux)
* Admin access on all client machines

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run Admin Server:

```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

### 2. Install Agent on Clients:

* Place agent script on each machine
* Run at startup or as a service

### 3. Deploy Software:

* Drop software in /files
* Send install command via API or CLI

## 🛡️ Security Tips

* Use pre-shared tokens or API keys
* Validate software with hashes (SHA256)
* Optionally wrap traffic in TLS using stunnel or VPN
