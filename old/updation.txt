sendlan.py
initial code

receivelan.py
initial code

updated version of the code 
--> connects sender and vm (in our case here)

it needs to select the file to send and download install setup silently as client can use immmediately
and acknowlege each time in sender machine like 
->sent
->installed 
->set up completed 

->if it is needed to be set up manually then acknowledge that too


this will silently install no need setting up after installation
