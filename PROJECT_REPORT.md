1 INTRODUCTION
The LAN Auto Installation System addresses the challenges of provisioning, configuring, and validating multiple endpoints across a local network. Traditional manual installation processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. By automating network discovery, configuration generation, remote deployment, and post-install validation, organizations can achieve faster rollouts with improved reliability and auditability.

- Configuration Management: Use templates and variables to generate device-specific configurations.
- Installation Deployment: Execute installers or scripts remotely using secure protocols.
- Monitoring and Validation: Track progress, collect logs, verify success criteria, and report results.

5 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- Architecture: Client/Server.
  - Server: Orchestrates scans, hosts artifacts, receives telemetry, manages jobs.
  - Client: Connects to server, receives payloads, executes tasks, returns results.
- Modules:
  - network: client, server, protocol, transfer, scanning utilities.
  - utils: configuration management, dynamic installer, virus scanning.
  - ui: operator interface widgets and views for server/client monitoring.
- Data Flow:
  - Operator configures a scan and deployment plan via UI.
  - Server scans IP ranges, builds inventory, and selects targets.
  - Configuration templates generate per-device settings.
  - Server or client transfers payloads; client executes and streams logs.
  - Monitoring module validates results and records metrics.

5.2 NETWORK TOPOLOGY DESIGN
- Focus on a single LAN segment with possible expansion to multiple subnets.
- Server placed within the LAN; clients discover/connect or are discovered via scanning.
- Firewall rules allow required ports for control and transfer.

5.3 DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS
- DFD Level 0: Operator -> Server -> Clients -> Operator (feedback loop).
- DFD Level 1: Scan -> Inventory -> Plan -> Deploy -> Validate -> Report.
- DFD Level 2 (Deploy): Artifact transfer -> Execution -> Telemetry -> Log storage.

5.4 DATABASE DESIGN
Suggested entities (if using a DB):
- devices(id, ip, hostname, os_hint, reachable_protocols, last_seen, tags)
- templates(id, name, version, role, path, checksum)
- jobs(id, name, created_at, created_by, status)
- job_targets(job_id, device_id, status, start_time, end_time, retry_count)
- artifacts(id, name, version, path, size, checksum)
- logs(id, target_id, timestamp, level, message)
- users(id, username, role, last_login)
Indexes on frequently queried fields (ip, status, timestamps). Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.

5.5 FRONTEND DESIGN
- Desktop GUI with views for:
  - Discovery (IP ranges, scan results)
  - Templates (list, edit, variables)
  - Deployments (create job, targets, progress)
  - Logs and Reports (filters, export)
